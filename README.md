# About this repository:

The main reason I did this is to show some evidence of my experience in university. I studied Mechatronics Engineering for over 4 years, and although it's hard to explain my relationship with it in a few lines and why I ended up leaving the course, I thought it was important to demonstrate what I did during my university phase. Obviously, it's not everything I learned and worked on, but it's something that shows well what I was doing.
Although Mechatronics is not directly related to Data Science, the foundational math is the same, so I was able to develop some intuition with calculations and certain engineering skills over the years.
The projects I worked on are different, but I wouldn't say they're simpler. In some respects, I would even say they're more complex, as you develop electronic, mechanical, and computational skills that allow you to perceive the importance of math in the physical field.

In addition to this, I want to attach my academic load to be able to visualize the subjects I took during my university phase n.n:

And if you wonder why, being so close to finishing, I left school, I'd be happy to explain!
